	    	</div>
    		<p>The brown trout were transferred from the TRAA hatchery and released at the same site on Medway Creek as in previous years.<br><br>
			TRAA members loaded up the trout fry into the transfer tank at the hatchery site. We then proceeded to the release site north of London, Ontario.<br><br>
			We were met there by two of the landowners through which this section of Medway Creek flows. They also brought out a large contingent of family and friends to lend a helping hand.
			This video gives you a pretty good idea how it went.<br><br>
			It was a beautiful day, the stream was in perfect shape and everyone was smiling and laughing. Good times.</p>

    		<p>Those of you who have been involved with the brown trout releases over the past few years may recognize this spot on Medway Creek as the release point.<br><br>
			Those of you who have been attending the last few General Meetings will also know that this is part of a 280-metre stretch on which we will be focusing future habitat rehabilitation efforts.<br><br>
			We have met with and have the support of the two landowners through which this stretch of Medway Creek flows.<br><br>
			Back in March we put together a short video of our stream walk on this section of Medway Creek, during which we documented areas in need of work and added our initial thoughts. Watch our video here.<br><br>
